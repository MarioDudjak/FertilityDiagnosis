# FertilityDiagnosis

Machine learning project for predicting fertility diagnosis output. 
I built Laravel application for users which serves like a global social network of users who use fertility diagnosis tool.
Users can register, use prediction tool, post their results and see global statistics.
Machine learning model is created in Azure machine learning studio and implemented in Laravel app via API. 

Application is hosted on heroku: http://fertilitydiagnosis.herokuapp.com/
